# Tic-Tac-Toe
TicTacToe developed with C++ with object-oriented design in mind (this project is from 2019).

## Objective
The sole objective of this project is mainly to focus on learning some ground-layer C++ code and how to build using a makefile. Over time, I expect the knowledge to grow from this project, but it's a great starting point.

## Example
Below we have a sample run of the application, first we're greeted with a welcoming message. After the welcome, we jump right into choosing which piece we want to be - for each play through this can be changed during runtime - and then in order to make a move on the board, you're only entering the numeric value for the field you're looking for. There is some safety built-in to prevent generic invalid inputs but don't count solely on that to be perfect (it's pretty good for expected values though).
